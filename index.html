							<p> In this website, both dithered images and a default typeface have been used to minimise 
								the carbon footprint of this site.</p>


								<p>Using dithered imagees on the website means there are fewer colours, and therefore can be compressed more efficiently. 
								This means the image file sizes are smaller, which requires less data to be transferred when someone visits this website. 
								Because data transfeer requires energy, using dithered images helps reduce the energy consumption and, in turn, lowers the carbon footprint 
								of the website. This is a small but impactful way to make websites more environmentally friendly. 
							</p>

								
							<p>Alongside this, using a default typeface can help lower the carbon footprint of a website because default 
								typefaces are usually already installed on a users device. This means that the website doesn't have tto load and transfer additional font files, whihc in turn,
								saves data and reduces energy consumption. This again is a simple way to make websites more efficient and eco-friendly. 

							</p>

							<h4 class="major">Low Carbon in future design </h4>
							<p>Low carbon web design is becoming increasingly important as our digital activities continue to have a significant environmental impact.
								As our digital  footprint continues to grow, so does the energy consumption of the internet.
								By implementing more practices such as optimising code, compreessing images, and minimising data transfer, we can reduce  the energy consumption
								and carbon emissions associated with website usage. This nott only helps combat climate change but also improves user experience 
								by making websites faster and more efficient. It could be an exciting opportunity to combine technology and sustainability for a better future.
